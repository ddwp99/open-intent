Open-intent is the only simple solution allowing you to create your own chat bot in minutes and easily deploy it on your infrastructure thanks to npm and docker.
As a virtual assistant, open-intent will understand the needs of your user via a conversation on messenger or your own
website and translate those intents into business actions.

# Example

This is as simple as this single line to start prototyping your bot

    npm install -g open-intent
    open-intent project create mychatbot

This command starts an instance of bot with model located in the mychatbot/res/ directory on your host. In
mychatbot/config, you'll find the configuration files for the available platforms. For now the only fully tested
platform is *Messenger* but you can try the others at your own risks.

Once the configuration is done, you can test your bot right away:

    open-intent project start mychatbot
     
Say 'hello' to your new bot!  You can then edit the model or config files and the bot restarts automatically when files are saved.

##Â Your first bot model

Below is the initial bot model you'll find in mychatbot/res/ when you create the instance. 3 files are required to
describe a bot. The dictionary of entities is the first one and is as follows:

    {
      "entities": {
        "@greetings": {
          "hello": ["hi", "yep", "yo", "hey"]
        },
        "@food_type": {
          "pizza": [],
          "hamburger": ["big mac", "cheeseburger", "burger"],
          "salad": []
        },
        "@number": {
          "regex": "[0-9]+"
        },
        "@yes": {
          "yes": []
        },
        "@no": {
          "no": []
        }
      }
    }

The Open-Intent Markup Language script is required to give example of the kind of business the bot will have to handle.
It uses the dictionary to find the user intent (an ordered list of entities). This is like teaching a little story that
will drive the conversations of your user.

    {
    @root
        -Hello
            #greetings
        -Would you want to eat a pizza, a hamburger or a salad?
    @get_food_type
        -Pizza, please.
            #get_food_type
            *I did not understand. Pizza, hamburger or salad?
        -Got it, you want _, right?
    @yesno
        -Yes!
            #confirm
        -I'm ordering, it is gonna be _$.
    @end
    }

    {
    @yesno
        -No!
            #notunderstood
        -Tell me what you want. Pizza, hamburger or salad?
    @get_food_type
    }

Of course, there is a Javascript file to handle your business logic when actions (keyword prefixed with #) are triggered.

    var food_type;
    module.exports = {
        "#get_food_type": function(intentVariables, sessionId, next) {
            var replyVariables = {};
            food_type = intentVariables['food_type0'];
            replyVariables['0'] = food_type;
            next(replyVariables);
        },
        "#confirm": function(intentVariables, sessionId, next) {
            var replyVariables = {};
            if(food_type == 'pizza') {
                replyVariables['0'] = '8';
            }
            else {
                replyVariables['0'] = '5';
            }
            next(replyVariables);
        }
    }


If you want to fully understand the model, we have created a

learn the basics on how to create your first bot with open-intent in 5 minutes.
